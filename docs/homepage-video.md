# Add your homepage video

The film section sits immediately below the hero and plays the supplied `public/besvideo.mp4` by default. It accepts MP4 or WebM, uses native play/pause, volume, seek, and fullscreen controls, and preserves the source video's proportions. The supplied film is portrait (480 × 848), so it has a dedicated portrait layout with a cover captured from the film. It never autoplays or downloads the video before the visitor chooses to watch.

## Use your raw file

1. Export the video as an H.264 MP4 with AAC audio for broad browser support. A compressed 1080p export is usually suitable for this placement; avoid serving a large camera-original file to mobile visitors.
2. Replace `public/besvideo.mp4` to update the current video without changing any settings.
3. To use a different file path, add this to `.env.local` (and to the hosting environment when deploying), and place the file at the matching location:

   ```env
   HOMEPAGE_VIDEO_URL="/videos/bes-expo.mp4"
   ```

4. Restart the local preview or rebuild/redeploy the website. No component changes are needed.

For large videos, upload the exported file to your media host or CDN and use its direct HTTPS file URL in `HOMEPAGE_VIDEO_URL`. YouTube webpage URLs are not direct video files and are not supported by this player.

Optional settings:

```env
HOMEPAGE_VIDEO_POSTER="/Images/your-video-poster.jpg"
HOMEPAGE_VIDEO_CAPTIONS="/videos/bes-expo.en.vtt"
```

Captions use WebVTT. For media on a different origin, serve captions from the website's own public directory. A video with spoken content should include accurate captions before publication.

## Upload through the existing Contentful CMS

Add these optional fields to the homepage content model:

| Field ID | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `homepageVideo` | Media, one file | Upload the MP4/WebM asset here. |
| `homepageVideoPoster` | Media, one image | Optional cover photograph. |
| `homepageVideoCaptions` | Media, one file | Optional WebVTT captions; the asset host must permit cross-origin access. |
| `homepageVideoTitle` | Short text | Optional section heading. |
| `homepageVideoDescription` | Long text | Optional introduction. |
| `homepageVideoUrl` | Short text | Optional direct HTTPS video URL instead of a media asset. |

Publish the assets and homepage entry. The existing `USECONTENTSTACK=true` switch and Contentful configuration must be enabled, with `FRONTEND_DEMO_MODE=false` for real CMS access in this checkout. A published CMS video takes precedence over the environment setting. If no CMS video is supplied, the environment setting or the default `/besvideo.mp4` is used.

There is no public upload form: video publishing uses your existing CMS access or your normal project deployment. Backend registration, account, and booking configuration is unaffected.
